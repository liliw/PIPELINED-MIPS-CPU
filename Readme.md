# Pipeline MIPS CPU
This project implements the theory of MIPS pipeline by Verilog and is simulated by ModelSim. 

## Know More
The five stages are **Instruction Fetch(IF), Instruction Decode(ID), Execution(EX), Memory(MEM),** and **Write Back(WB)**. In this design, one clock cycle is 20 ns; every signal is triggered at a positive edge. Data in register and memory are provided. The testing instructions include **lw, beq, add, sub, j, or,** and **sw**.
